Justin's C++ Markov Weather System
Why?
Cause it’s cool! Previous to creating this, I had no idea what a ‘Markovs chart Weather Probability simulator” even was and it took me about an hour to wrap my head around it. After I got my bearings, I discovered what it could do. A fluid and realistic weather simulation that can be implemented into games.
